Default keybind for the macro : "y"
Probably the simpliest GUI I've ever made to the point where I publish its source.
- Here's a tutorial on how to setup the macro:    
First, choose the message that you want the script to send once you press the keybind.

In order to change the keybind, head into the top right corner and click on the settings icon.

It'll open a new ui called Settings and there you can change 2 things: The keybind and the activity of the script. So if you want to stop it for a certain time then just toggle it off.

Further versions will come with further updates so yeah stay tuned I guess.
